# CapTable
> Simple app for tracking a company cap table information.

Insert your companies founders, employees, and investors information to get ownership data.

## Installation

To start the application locally, start by installing the applications dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Start app locally

To run the app locally use the `npm run start` script after all dependencies have been installed.

```sh
npm run start
```

## API/Backend

I added a simple JSON Server to return data, start the API by running simultaneously with the app's start script.

```sh
npm run startAPI
```

## Demo Data

The authentication is still a work in progress, but for now by clicking the sign-in button on the top right, it will use the JSON server to populate the app with demo data.

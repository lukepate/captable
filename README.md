# CapTable
> Simple app for tracking a company cap table.

Insert your companies founders, employees, and investors information to get ownership data.

## Installation

To start the application locally, start by installing the applications dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Start APP locally

To run the app locally use the `npm run start` script after all dependencies have been installed.

```sh
npm run startAPI
```

## API/Backend

I added a simple JSON Server to return data, start the API by running simultaneously with the app's start script.

```sh
npm run startAPI
```
